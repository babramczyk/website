### About

After graduating with a CS degree from [UW-Madison](/school/) in 2017, I started off my professional career at a Madison-based startup called [AkitaBox](/akitabox/). After two formative years there, I moved back to my hometown of Milwaukee in 2019 where I landed a job on the innovation team at [Northwestern Mutual](/northwestern-mutual/), which is where I'm lucky to be now.

I take a lot of pride in developing my range -- not just as an engineer, but as a teammate. I've been lucky to explore and develop this range professionaly; from nerding out on [tech](/toolkit/) like React and AWS, to collaborating with the product team on UI/UX design, to team leading and ticket grooming, to teaching and mentorship.
