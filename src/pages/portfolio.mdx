In 2019, I designed and developed a rudimentary website for the Milwaukee band The Doofi. Here's a preview:

It was a ton of fun to build and helped me develop my creative side and design skills. There's definitely some things I would do differently if I had to start over again, and things I would add if they wanted me to do any additional work.

Plus, they're an awesome band, so I was happy to help them out ðŸ˜„
