At Northwestern Mutual, I've been lucky to be a part of the innovation team. The team's motivations are in the title -- we take and create ideas, innovate and execute on them, and move onto the next one.

This has manifested itself in different ways depending on the project. Sometimes, it's taking an idea in an adjacent market and working on it like it's its own separate startup (see ProQuo below). Other times, it may mean taking an idea someone on our team or elsewhere in the company had to drive up efficiency and automation for NM financial reps.

No matter the project, they've always involved starting from square one, taking the idea from the research/discovery/development phase all the way until a production rollout.

## Projects

### Plan Execution

Plan Execution was a project to develop, research, and test an app that automates a users financial goals.

A financial rep could help a user come up with concrete, prioritized goals for a client, then hand it off to our system to do the money movement automatically for them each month.

After 6 months of research and development, we successfully got the company to notice the product's viability; the project was handed off to another team for continued development.

### ProQuo

ProQuo started off as a platform that gave athletes rewards for performing well in public events. These "bounties" gave the users discounts from retailers like Nike and Garmin, in exchange for the user's consented data.

As the pandemic hit and events and races started to shut down, ProQuo made a pivot to become a racing platform. We'd noticed how a lot of the race managers we were working with had a need here, and it provided a new route to move forward and stay relevant with as COVID remained detrimental.

### MIB

MIB is a vendor that works with healthcare organization to serve up electronic health records (EHRs) through an API. We wanted to figure out if it could be a viable solution for more efficient underwriting.

As the sole engineer on this project, it was my job to build some scripts that could ingest >17,000 NM applicants, search for EHRs using MIB's API, and report back the hit rate and speed of results. The results of this research/POC was the eventual green-light and handoff for a different team to build out a fully featured app.

### Exam Connect

Exam Connect is a webapp that helps financial representatives schedule paramedical exams for insurance applicants.

Exam Connect was piloted successfully, and handed off to another team for maintenance. Financial reps now use this daily, providing a much smoother process than the old days of calling back and forth between applicant and exam vendor.

## Other responsibilities

- As the innovation engineer team ~doubled in size from when I joined, I helped foster a learning and welcoming culture
