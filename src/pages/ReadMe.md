  Hi! I'm Brett 👋
</h1>

I'm a full stack engineer that loves creating software that improves the lives of others 🙂

## Guiding Principles

Specifically, I tend to use the following principles when building a product:

<p>
  <span style={{ marginRight: ".75rem" }}>📦</span>
  Code is purely the means to the <strong>product's</strong> end
</p>

<p>
  <span style={{ marginRight: ".75rem" }}>🤔</span>
  <strong>Pragmaticism</strong> is fundamental to meeting that end
  <br />
</p>

<p>
  <span style={{ marginRight: ".75rem" }}>📝</span>
  <strong>Learning</strong> never stops
</p>

Anyways... welcome to my website! 😀

The files on the left are a good way to learn about me. They're a bit looser and more detailed than what'd you get from a resume.

If that's not your jam right now and would rather get a birdseye view of my experience, you can take a look at <a href="/assets/brett-abramczyk.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a> itself.
