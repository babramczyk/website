# AkitaBox

_2017 –– 2019_

<br />

AkitaBox was my first job out of school. It was an absolute **dream** job, and had a huge role in shaping who I am as an engineer and teammate. AkitaBox is a SaaS company for facility management -- offering an array of apps that helps facility managers to maintenance technicians keep a building up-to-date without manual spreadsheets or scattered legal pads tracking their data.

It was a startup, and still in the early phases when I joined (~30 employees). But by the time I left after 2 years, that was more like 90 employees. It was super interesting to not only witness the different phases of growth of a startup, but also participate in shaping what they looked like.

I'm proud of my personal growth there. I started off as a Junior SE that was willing to just work like crazy and stay until 2am for deployments and hotfixes.

#### Removing the "Junior"

After 6 months or so, I was promoted to SE and earned the opportunity to have a voice in more impactful conversations (participation in design review, technical direction, customer relationships).

#### Up to team lead

After a year in that role, I was promoted to Team Lead of the agile team I had been working on. We never quite had a "real" team lead so far in my team there (people would filter in and out, or just fill in in the interim), so there was a void to be filled there. I had been filling it for months out of necessity of the team (helping groom tickets, leading meetings, collaboration with the product team), so my manager finally decided to make it official. He called this "volunteer leadership" at the time, and I've tried to take that attitude into my job ever since.

#### On and on...

I could keep going about how it was to manage people with more experience than me, the life and pressures of working at a startup, the relationships I had; but I would probably go on way too long for what this website is set up for. In short, AkitaBox will always hold a special place in my heart.
